This project is not complete. Things unravelled on me in the last day. I spent far too much time untangling a CORS-related issue and ran out of time to finish my other microservices. I have ONE out of four in place, the Ohm's Law Calculator. The rest is skeletal, mostly in need of frontend code to hook up to backend. I had more of the backend done than frontend.

The frontend can be run from VSCode Live Server, and the project files should include a settings.json that will cause Live Server to use the correct /frontend root in the project files.

I used Nodemon to run the backend, with my terminal cd'd into the backend directory.

Like exercise3, hopefully by the time you come to grade my assignment you will be able to visit gcp.lynxpardia.xyz/assign3/ to view my GCP deployment.
